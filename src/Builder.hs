-- @Ghc Stage0@ is the bootstrapping compiler
-- @Ghc StageN@, N > 0, is the one built on stage (N - 1)
-- @GhcPkg Stage0@ is the bootstrapping @GhcPkg@
-- @GhcPkg StageN@, N > 0, is the one built in Stage0 (TODO: need only Stage1?)
-- TODO: Do we really need HsCpp builder? Can't we use a generic Cpp
--       builder instead? It would also be used instead of GccM.
-- TODO: rename Gcc to CCompiler? We sometimes use gcc and sometimes clang.
-- TODO: why are Gcc/GccM staged?
